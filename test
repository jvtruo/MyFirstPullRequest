    "Not only was COVID a high-risk time for physical illness, but it also allowed for mental illness to boom as a result. COVID quarantine proved to be a very isolating time worldwide, which can heighten both depression levels and alcohol abuse levels. Based on the study conducted by the American Addiction Centers, it states that research shows that there seems to be a bidirectional relationship between alcohol use and depressive disorders <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). This means that alcohol abuse can affect mental health and mental health can affect alcohol abuse. This bidirectional relationship shows that these variables have a cyclic nature in the way they continuously affect each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not the only relationship that is being explored. Another prior work study about this topic is discussed in the article by the National Library of Medicine showing how frequent alcohol usage decreased from pre- to post-COVID-19 period <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This helps to understand how the relationship between alcohol abuse and depression levels is affected by COVID in general.\n",

    "The dataset’s sampling may introduce potential biases, retrieving data from certain subpopulations may be less representative and those with limited healthcare access or from other socioeconomic factors could be underrepresented. This underrepresentation can affect a fair analysis, as trends in mental health and alcohol use may differ across different demographic groups. \n",
